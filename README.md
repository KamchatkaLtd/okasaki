Okasaki/Scala ![build status](https://travis-ci.org/KamchatkaLtd/okasaki.svg)
=============

The code here is a Scala implementation of data structures and solutions to exercises from the great book
 ["Purely Functional Data Structures" by Chris Okasaki](http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504).
